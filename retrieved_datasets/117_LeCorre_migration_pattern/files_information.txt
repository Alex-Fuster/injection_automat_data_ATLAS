#command:
R script for the cluster analysis and the random forest analysis

#estipop_rfh/rgh:
Rivière-George herd (rfh) and Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd (rgh) population time series used in the 1000 runs of the random forest analysis

#WRcentro.txt:
locations of the centroid of the individual winter break with their assigned cluster
- idanimal: caribou ID
- herd: 1 -> Rivière-George herd; 2 -> Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd
- year
- bwin: beginning date of the winter range use
- ewin: ending date of the winter range use
- x/y: coordinates of the mean winter location (NAD83 Quebec Lambert, WKID: EPSG 32198)
- cluster: cluster assigned to the centroid after running the cluster analysis
cluster analysis was performed on rgh and rfh separately

#db_rf.txt:
database used for the random forest analysis
- ind: individual number
- idanimal: caribou ID
- herd: 1 -> Rivière-George herd; 2 -> Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd
- year
- cluster
- st_sep/oct: mean temperatures encountered in September/October
- swe_sep/oct: mean snow water equivalent encountered in September/October
- pcp_sep/oct: mean precipitations encountered in September/October
- ndvi_jul/aug/sep/oct: mean NDVI of July/August/September/October

#output files of the RF:
- tabimp_rfh/rgh: variable importance calculated for each RF (n=1000) for the different classes (not used) and the global model (used in the study). Ranks were added using Excel. 
- taberr_rfh/rgh: classification error rate for the classes and the global model
