MYLU_microsatellites_GENEPOP.txt
Microsatellite data for all adult genotypes as coded/presented in a Genepop input file

Loci ordering: Mluc1, Mluc4, Mluc5, Mluc7, Mluc8, Mluc11, Mluc21, Mluc25, Mluc34

pop separators: in order Pop11, Pop1, Pop2, Pop13, Pop3, Pop4, Pop12, Pop5, Pop6, Pop7, Pop14, Pop15, Pop8, Pop9, Pop10, 

Individual lines coded as Sample ID, then followed by loci data as Allele1, Allele2 (in 2-digit form).


File 2
STRUCTURE_MYLU_mainparams.txt
This file contains the parameters for the STRUCTURE run without prior knowledge of sampling locations
STRUCTURE was run on a server hence the file type.


File 3
STRUCTURE_MYLU_infile.txt
This file contains the microsatellite loci data used in the STRUCTURE analysis.  Individual lines are coded with a combined identifier
that contains first the Population corresponding to that in the manuscript.  It is followed by three zeros as place holders, and lastly the sample number for that population as 2 digits.
The second column contains the population number for use by the program and then the loci data follow in each row as Allele1, Allele2.  


File 4
MYLU_mtDNA_arlequin_infile.txt
This file contains the mitochondrial DNA sequence data for adult bats sampled at the 15 swarming sites.
Encoded in the file is the provincial grouping of the sites (n= 3 provinces) used in the AMOVA hierarchical
analysis.  Group 1 is Nova Scotia, Group 2 is New Brunswick and Group 3 is Quebec.
