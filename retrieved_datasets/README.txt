Dataset used in the analysis of Diptera availability and Tree Swallow reproductive success and nestling body condition 
across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Quebec, Canada (2006-2016). Column names are the set of 
predictor variables described in text and Table 1. Numerical variables have been z-transformed. The following are
additional column headers not explicitly stated in Table 1.

Year = Year the data was collected
Farm = Farm ID
YearFarm = Unique Farm/Year ID
FarmNB = Unique Farm/Nest Box ID
Biomass = Biomass (g) of Diptera for a specific Year/Farm/Day combination
Dur = duration (days) of the nestling period as described in text body.
Noisnes = Brood size
Noisenvol = Number of fledglings
Masse16 = Nestling body mass at 16 days post-hatching.
wing = Nestling 9th primary length at 16 days post-hatching.
